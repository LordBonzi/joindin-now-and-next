An alarmingly hacky script to show now + next for an event with its schedule on <joind.in>

## Installation

Clone this repo, then install the dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```
composer install
```

Edit the `public/index.php` file to add the API URL for your event.

## Usage

Point your webserver to the `public/` directory or for development use try the built-in server:

```
cd public/
php -S localhost:8080
```

## Contributing

Patches very welcome.
